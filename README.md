Wikipedia pages about philosophers frequently show lists of philosophers who influenced or were influenced by the page's namesake philosopher.

An example from [John Dewey's wiki:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Dewey "John Dewey")

I thought it would be fun to use [d3](https://d3js.org/ "d3js") to make a force-directed graph showing a selection of philosophers and their respective influences (according to their Wiki authors, anyway).
